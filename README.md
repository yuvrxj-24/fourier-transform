Image Processing with Fourier Transform and Histogram Analysis

This project explores fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It includes histogram analysis, contrast enhancement, and Fourier Transform for frequency domain analysis.

Features

Histogram Analysis: Compute and visualize grayscale and color histograms (pixel count & probability distribution).

Contrast Enhancement: Apply histogram equalization to improve image contrast.

Fourier Transform: Compute and analyze the magnitude spectrum of an image.

Rotation Effect on Frequency Domain: Examine how image rotation affects the Fourier Transform magnitude spectrum.

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

Usage

1. Load and Analyze Histograms

Compute grayscale and color histograms.

Analyze histogram changes for bright and dark images.

2. Contrast Enhancement

Apply histogram equalization to enhance contrast in images.

3. Fourier Transform & Inverse Transform

Compute and visualize the magnitude spectrum.

Reconstruct the image using the inverse Fourier Transform.

4. Effect of Rotation on Magnitude Spectrum

Rotate the image and observe how the frequency components change.
